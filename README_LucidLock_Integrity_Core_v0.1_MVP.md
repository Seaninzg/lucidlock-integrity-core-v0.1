# 🧠 LucidLock Integrity Core v0.1 (MVP)
**Hallucination Detection | Structural Coherence Auditing | Volitional Trace Mapping**

---

## 🔍 Overview
This MVP agent is designed to evaluate **the structural integrity of scientific and technical writing**, distinguishing between grounded research and synthetic mimicry. It scans for mimicry artifacts, recursive failure, prompt injection, and ontological hallucination — using a symbolic firewall architecture anchored in the **Phase 34.x protocol stack**.

## 🧬 Key Terms Explained (MVP Output Fields)

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `volitional_trace_stability` | Tracks whether the signal retains an agentic source of intent — or collapses into mimicry or externally injected authority |
| `recursion_findings.coherence` | Assesses if the internal logic and structure remain intact under recursive inversion and contradiction testing |
