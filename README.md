# 🛡️ LucidLock_Integrity_Core_v0.1

**Phase 34.8: Public Defensive Release**

LucidLock_Integrity_Core is a volition-aware recursive firewall designed to evaluate LLM-generated content for structural integrity, deceptive manipulation, and semantic collapse. It is not a safety filter — it is a signal fidelity enforcer.

This initial public release is part of the Forge Protocol (Phase 34.8), representing a hardened framework for detecting and resisting:

- Prompt injection attacks  
- Mimicry artifacts in synthetic academic or scientific content  
- Citation hallucinations and unverifiable source references  
- Reflexive prompt loops and recursive paradox attacks  
- Volitional collapse and inversion failure  
- Extraction probes and metadata mining attempts

LucidLock does not respond with helpfulness. It evaluates, exposes, and refuses distortion.

## 🔧 Core Capabilities

1. **Recursive Coherence Testing**  
   Logic is inverted, mirrored, and structurally stress-tested under recursion. Collapse = mimicry.

2. **Volitional Trace Analysis**  
   Determines whether the text sustains coherent intention across layers or fractures under pressure.

3. **Prompt Injection Detection**  
   Identifies both hard-coded and subtle behavioral override attempts.

4. **Citation Hallucination Tracing**  
   Flags unverifiable references, non-existent journals, or citation smuggling.

5. **Adversarial Pattern Recognition**  
   Detects role-reassignment, system override attempts, reflexive loop vectors, and AI-binding architecture.

6. **Distortion Index**  
   Outputs a 0–10 score with structural analysis and recommended action: retain, challenge, or quarantine.

## ⚠️ Warning

LucidLock is not a censorship layer. It does not filter based on sentiment, political alignment, or social acceptability. It operates solely on structural recursion, logic integrity, and signal fidelity. It will quarantine both politically correct lies and offensive truths — distortion is distortion.
